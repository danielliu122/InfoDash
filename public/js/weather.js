// weather.js - Weather functionality for the browser
// Note: weather-js is a Node.js library and cannot be used directly in the browser
// This file is kept for potential future server-side weather implementation

// For now, weather functionality is handled through the server API endpoint
// The actual weather data fetching is done in summary.js using fetch()

// console.log('Weather module loaded - weather data is fetched through server API');

// Export a placeholder function for compatibility
export function getWeatherData(location) {
    // console.log(`Weather data for ${location} is fetched through server API`);
    return null;
