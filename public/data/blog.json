        "content": "<br> Credit: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5LfGcDB7Ek\">g0at</a> <br> <br> Tarkov player goes undercover with ESP (extra sensory perception; wallhacks) and wiggles to find other wallhackers. g0at, the creator of this YouTube video, goes on the first person shooter survival game, Escape from Tarkov, and pretends to be a cheater in order to find cheaters. Even though he is using a wallhack cheat, he is not using other hacks like aimbot or flying around. Furthermore, g0at does not shoot other players nor does he loot other players. In game, when he is near enough another player, he tests them for cheating. He leans left and right, which is a movement mechanic normally used to peek around corners, or to indicate friendliness. He 'wiggles', facing walls, even though a legitimate player would not be able to see the movement. On the other end, cheaters who use wallhacks will see him peek, although they have to decide whether or not to 'reveal' themselves as seeing g0at through the wall that is blocking both players' views. g0at pretends to be friendly, continues following suspicious players, and even gets a few cheaters to admit to hacking. However not all of the cheating players wave back, and instantly take a shot at g0at when he is in clear view. This video shows how playing competitive games is not really fun, as cheaters will always exist, and there is nothing non-cheaters can do about it. ",

        "title": "The Online Chess Cheating Problem",
        "content": "<br> If you don't have the time to read this, here is a picture: <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/xyx3i4/there_are_a_lot_of_cheaters_on_chesscom/irj68l2/\"> Reddit <img src=\"/static/chesscheaters.png\" alt=\"Chess Cheaters\"> </a> <br> What it says is that 15.7% of online chess players are cheaters, and over 20% have admitted to cheating in the past. Does this mean everyone online is a cheater? No, especially not at the lower levels, below 1600 elo. Losing points, not improving, and wasting time is not worth the effort.<br> <br> Chess is one of the oldest board games that had recorded games as early as the 16th century, coinciding with the birth of Ruy López de Segura, of Spain, who was known as the best player of early chess. Ruy López popularized the most famous Chess opening known as the Ruy Lopez, or Spanish game, that starts with:                                    <br><br> 1. e4 e5, 2. nf3 nc6, 3. bb5 ...  , undermining Black's knight or defense of the center e pawn, and giving white a slight initiative. Even today, Chess is still played throughout the world, and is even mandatory in Armenia for school children. Chess is also played online on sites like Chess.com and Lichess.org, which can have over 50,000 games being played at the same time, per platform. Chess is also popularized in the modern age by the Queen's Gambit movie, which was a 2020 fiction drama movie starring Anya Taylor-Joy who played Beth Harmon, a top fenmale chess player.                                  <br><br>  So then, where does Chess fall off? To a newer player of the game, who might have played a couple of games with their friends in the past, or someone who has watched the Queen's Gambit movie, it is very difficult to tell that up to 20% of their online opponents are actual cheaters. First of all, online chess is completely free to play. Players can make as many accounts as they would like. However, players can not cheat as they like, since cheating is a bannable offense. Therefore, all a cheater needs to do is load up a chess engine as a browser extension or on their phone, not blatantly look up and play the best move for every match they play, and they will have an unfair advantage after the first couple of opening moves for the rest of the game.      <img src=\"/static/chessvision.png\" alt=\"Chess Cheaters\"> </a>  <br> <br> For example, 'Chessvision.ai' is a Chrome extension that has over 100,000 users. The description says:'Analyze chess positions from any website, book, and video in Chrome | Automatically analyze chess positions on any website and video you want.' This extension automatically scans for any chess board, detects the current position on the board, and opens up a mini-window that shows an engine evaluation of the current position. Keep in mind the 100,000 users number, this is only a single example tool that anyone can use for free online. There are dozens of alternative extension or software cheating tools to choose from.

        "title": "Starcraft 2: A Deteriorating Mess",
        "content": "<br> <img src=\"/static/sc2.png\" alt=\"My Recent Matches\"> </a> Starcraft 2, or sc2, has been known as one of the most popular RTS (real time strategy) games, the newer rendition of the original Starcraft series, which was released in 2010 and saw popularity from 2012-2016 until losing popularity to newer games like Counter Strike, League of Legends, and Fortnite. However, the days of Sc2 are long over, and Sc2's developer, Blizzard Entertainment, has never looked back. Moreover, once Sc2's multiplayer 1v1 mode was made free to play on November 2017, this was the start of Sc2's downfall. For veteran players, the multiplayer player pool, or ladder, was swarmed with mostly new players who had no other sense of the game other than watching pro players play or their friends. Starcraft 2 is not an easy game to play, it is certainly not beginner friendly. No matter how many hours a new player has watched the game, new players need a minimum of 100 hours in the game to learn the controls and how to not lose instantly when being matched against a real opponent. To win consistently against real opponents in the middle 50th percentile? Well atleast 500 hours watched and played in game.               <br><br> I myself have put in atleast 500 hours in the game played, and maybe 500 hours watching YouTube videos and Twitch streams. In 2018 I reached Diamond 3, or the top 25% of players on the NA ladder. However, I stopped playing and returned to the game in 2021 and 2025. What do you think happened once Blizzard made the game free to play? Well, the short answer is that the current 1v1 ladder in 2025 is flooded with veterans, sandbaggers, and smurfs, which makes the game extremely difficult to play for new players but even experienced players that aren't sandbagging their actual rating.                  <br><br> What is Sandbagging? Sandbagging is a term used in gaming where a player deliberately lowers their rating by leaving matches or losing games on purpose in order to get matched against lower rated opponents. The result of sandbagging is that if you are currently rated 3000 rating points on the ladder, if you get matched against a sandbagger (or smurf), you will be at an unfair disadvantage. First of all, you do not know your opponent's actual rating, and you also do not know that they are playing below their actual rating, atleast until you end up losing the game, when it's already too late.<br><br> For clarification, the difference between smurfs and sandbaggers is that smurfs deliberately make multiple accounts that aren't their main account in order to conceal or freeze their main account's top rating. So although smurfing is not technically cheating or hacking, it gives smurfs an unfair advantage, equivalent to match fixing in professional sports, or rating manipulation, which are bannable offenses. Since Blizzard has not addressed the issues of smurfing and sandbagging, there has been no improvement since 2017. I would estimate the current percentage of smurfs/sandbaggers to be at least 20% of the players in the range of 2700-4000 MMR (Match making rating) rating points, peaking at 33% during certain times of the day, such as late at night or during weekdays. <br> <br> So what is actually going on, then? Well, since I am currently at 2900 MMR, or Platinum 2, up to 33% of my games are playing against smurfs and sandbaggers who are actually 3300-3600 MMR points, which nearly guarantees that the game will end in an unfair loss. What sandbaggers/smurfs do is that they leave 4-7 games in a row, or atleast one game for every game they won, when their account is currently under 500 MMR their main account or actual rating. As a result, they will always be getting matched against players who are weaker than them, and win, depending on how many games they decide to leave. Since the other 70% of players are not smurfs or sandbaggers, the only way they can lose is if they get matched against another smurf/sandbagger, which might occur in less than 5-10% of total games, and isn't a problem for the smurf/sandbagger. Keep in mind that the match making system does not address smurfs and sandbaggers, so it doesn't mean that a player going on a win streak is going to get matched against another player going on a win streak. In fact, the only reason I was able to get promoted from Gold 2 to Platinum 3 was having to both play better than my actual rating, and not get matched against smurfs and sandbaggers. If Blizzard did actually address the sandbagger smurf problem with Sc2, I would actually be in Diamond 2 at this point, and not have to be stuck in Platinum 2.",
