        "content": "<br> Credit: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5LfGcDB7Ek\">g0at</a>Tarkov player goes undercover and wiggles to find wallhackers.g0at, the creator of this YouTube video, goes on the first person shooter survival game, Escape from Tarkov, and pretends to be a cheater in order to find cheaters. In game, he leans left and right, which is a movement mechanic normally used to peek around corners, or to indicate friendliness. He wiggles facing walls, even though he cannot see through walls. On the other end, certain cheaters will see him peek, but since they are cheating, the wall is not a visual deterrent, and some might even think that he is also wallhacking. However, he isn't. g0at pretends to be friendly, doesn't get shot, and even gets a few cheaters to admit to hacking. This video shows that it's a general waste of time to play competitive games, as cheaters will always exist, and there is nothing you can do about it.",

Does this mean everyone online is a cheater? No, especially not at the lower levels, below 1600 elo. Losing points, not improving, and wasting time is not worth the effort.",
